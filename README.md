# Unsupervised Learning: FIFA 23 Player Statistics Analysis

This project involves selecting an open data set related to FIFA 23 player statistics. The aim is to clean, visualize, and apply various unsupervised learning techniques to deeply analyze and understand the data.


### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The goal of this project is to apply unsupervised learning methods to analyze FIFA 23 player statistics, revealing hidden patterns and providing a deeper understanding of player performance and attributes.


### ðŸ“Š Project Steps

1. **Data Selection**:
   - Choose a relevant open data set containing comprehensive statistics on FIFA 23 players, including attributes such as skill ratings, positions, and performance metrics.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Address data quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies to ensure accuracy and reliability for further analysis.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Utilize various visualization techniques to explore the data, including:
     - **Histograms** to understand the distribution of player attributes.
     - **Scatter Plots** to investigate relationships between different metrics.
     - **Box Plots** to identify outliers and variability.

4. **Application of Unsupervised Learning Techniques**:
   - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving significant variance to visualize and interpret underlying patterns.
   - **Factor Analysis (FA)**: Uncover latent factors that explain correlations among player attributes to understand performance dimensions.
   - **Clustering**: Apply algorithms such as K-means or hierarchical clustering to group players based on statistical profiles and identify distinct performance patterns.
  
5. **Analysis and Interpretation**:
   - Evaluate and interpret the results from unsupervised learning techniques to understand relationships and patterns in player performance. Discuss the significance of clusters and principal components. All these insights will be commented on in the project's `.rmd` or `.html`file.
