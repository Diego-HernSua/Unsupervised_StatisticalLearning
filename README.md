### 📊 Project Steps

1. **📂 Data Selection**:
   - Select a relevant open dataset containing comprehensive statistics on FIFA 23 players, including attributes such as skill ratings, positions, and performance metrics.

2. **🧹 Data Cleaning**:
   - Address data quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies to ensure the accuracy and reliability of further analysis.

3. **📈 Data Visualization**:
   - Utilize various visualization techniques to explore the data:
     - **Histograms**: Understand the distribution of player attributes.
     - **Scatter Plots**: Investigate relationships between different metrics.
     - **Box Plots**: Identify outliers and variability in player statistics.

4. **🔍 Application of Unsupervised Learning Techniques**:
   - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving significant variance to visualize and interpret underlying patterns.
   - **Factor Analysis (FA)**: Uncover latent factors that explain correlations among player attributes, enhancing the understanding of performance dimensions.
   - **Clustering**: Apply clustering algorithms to group players based on statistical profiles and identify distinct performance patterns.

5. **📝 Analysis and Interpretation**:
   - Evaluate and interpret the results from unsupervised learning techniques to uncover relationships and patterns in player performance. Discuss the significance of clusters and principal components. All these insights will be commented on in the project's `.rmd` or `.html` file.
